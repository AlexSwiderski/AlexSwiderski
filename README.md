Hello! I am a licensed Speech and Language Pathologist and Ph.D candidate at the University of Pittsburgh in the college of [Communication Science and Disorders]( https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/csd)  and at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Center for [Neural basis of cognition]( https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/). My advisors are William Hula PhD CCC-SLP and Michael Walsh Dickey PhD. Throughout my tenure as a clinical researcher, I have gained expertise in latent trait modeling of cognitive processes and machine learning, specifically Natural Language Processing and neural network modeling. 

My dissertation focuses on decoding functional magnetic resonance imaging data from people with aphasia to 1) Understand how the brain encodes semantic information, 2) Investigate the utility of decoding blood oxygen level dependent signals back to individual experimental stimuli, and 3) Identify the relationship between brain decoder models and clinical measures of language deficits.

My long-term goals are to continue integrating my clinical training with neuroimaging and/or neuropsychological testing data to develop neurobiologically plausible models of how the healthy and impaired brain process language. 
While I am not working, I enjoy rock climbing and paddle boarding with my wife Carly and relaxing with our family of three dogs: Rooster, Ava, and Ruby.
